This project was bootstrapped with Create React App
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

To install the dependencies package.
#### npm install

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
#### npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.


Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
#### npm test

See the section about running tests for more information
https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
#### npm run build
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about deployment for more information.
https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
#### npm run eject


If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
